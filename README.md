Hello & welcome to my landing page project. 

first i want to thank you for spending your time to review my project. 

my project starts as following below. 

1- My project started with creating the nav bar lists. 

2 - The second block of code will show how to add the active class to the menu list.

3-The third block of code will show how to add the active class to the sections while scrolling but not only the section also the nav bar list that is linked to this section 

4-The forth  block of code is responsible of hiding the nav bar when the user is not scrolling for 10 seconds 

5- Last block of code is for to the “ back to top “ button and how it behaves 

6-Also i’ve made the nav bar responsive using the media query in CSS file
